# tailwind-colours-in-regular-css
Get tailwindcss colours in your regular, plain CSS files without installing tailwind.

# why
Useful if you're lazy (like me) and always use Tailwind default colours everywhere, but aren't using Tailwind this one time.

# how to use parse-colours.js
Copy the table (and only the table) from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors and paste it into the raw constant defined in the parser file.

The code is very hastily written so don't take it for granted that it'll work if Tailwind Docs' layout changes.
